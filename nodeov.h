                                Classes of descriptors of nodes of Overlap graph
The overlap graph OvGraph of a given pattern H is an oriented graph with the set of nodes
OV(HH) and a set of edges  that is a union of three subsets, left, right and deep edges, that are defined as follows:
  - A left edge links node w to node t iff w = lpred(t);
  - A right edge links node w to node t iff t = rpred(w).
  - A deep edge links node w to node t iff exists a non-empty class H*(w, t),

 where OV(HH) - set of overlap nodes; lpred(t) (rpred(t)) - maximal prefix (suffix) of t from OV(HH);
class H*(w,t) - subset of pattern words h, where lpred(h) = w and rpred(H) = t 

Node w is left (right) deep, iff exists a word h from HH, where lpred(h) = w (rpred(h) = w)
